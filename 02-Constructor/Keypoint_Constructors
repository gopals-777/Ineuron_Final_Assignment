***********************CONSTRUCTORS IN JAVA***********************************

Constructors in Java are special methods used to initialize objects of a class.
They have the same name as the class and are automatically called when an object is created using the "new" keyword. 
Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.


***************Key points about constructors:**************
---------------------------------------------------------------

1) Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects of a class.

2) The constructor name must match the class name.

3) Constructors have no return type, not even void.

4) If a class does not define any constructors, a default constructor with no arguments is automatically provided.

5)Constructors can be overloaded, allowing a class to have multiple constructors with different parameter lists.

6)The super() keyword is used to invoke the parent class constructor from the child class constructor.

7)If the super() keyword is not explicitly used in a child class constructor, the default (parameterless) constructor of the parent class is implicitly called.

8)Constructors can perform initialization tasks, set initial values of instance variables, and execute any necessary setup for objects.

9)Constructors are automatically called when an object is created using the new keyword.

10)Constructors can be used to create copy constructors that initialize a new object by copying values from an existing object.

11) Constructors can also call other constructors within the same class using the this() keyword, allowing for constructor chaining.

Types of Constructors in Java
 primarily there are three types of constructors in Java 
 1) No-Argument Constructor
 2) Parameterized Constructor
 3) Default Constructor
 
 1. No-Argument Constructor in Java
A constructor that has no parameter is known as the No-argument or Zero argument constructor. 
If we donâ€™t define a constructor in a class, then the compiler creates a constructor(with no arguments) for the class. 
And if we write a constructor with no arguments, the compiler does not create a default constructor. 

 2. Parameterized Constructor in Java
A constructor that has parameters is known as parameterized constructor.
If we want to initialize fields of the class with our own values, then use a parameterized constructor.

 3. Default Constructor in Java
A constructor that has no parameters is known as default the constructor.
A default constructor is invisible.
And if we write a constructor with no arguments, the compiler does not create a default constructor.
It is taken out. It is being overloaded and called a parameterized constructor.
